## Overview
`spaces` provides a set of vector space primitives for machine learning
problems. Traits such as `Space`, and it's derivatives, may be used to define
state/action spaces, for example. Mappings between different spaces may also be
defined which simplify many common preprocessing tasks.

## Installation
```toml
[dependencies]
spaces = "3.2"
```
